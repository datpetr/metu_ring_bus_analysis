# Data Preparation & Sampling Design Decisions

## Sampling Method: Stratified Sampling

**We use: Stratified Random Sampling by Residence**

- Divide population into 3 residence strata
- Randomly sample from within each stratum
- Combine results weighted by stratum size
- More efficient than simple random sampling

---

## Decision 1: Why 3 Groups Instead of 9?

**Problem with 9 groups:**
- Some groups too small (n=2 to n=5)
- Small groups = unreliable estimates
- One outlier can skew entire group

**Solution: Collapse to 3 groups**
- East Campus: n=138
- West Campus: n=114
- Off-campus: n=71

**Benefits:**
- ✓ Large, stable sample sizes
- ✓ Similar efficiency gain (~2%)
- ✓ Credible, defensible results

---

## Decision 2: Why NOT Transform Data?

**Why transformations don't work:**
- Likert scales (1-5) are discrete by nature
- Log/sqrt transforms destroy interpretability
- "log(3.5)" has no meaning for satisfaction

**Why raw data is fine:**
- Sample size n≥71 per group is large
- Central Limit Theorem applies to sample means
- Non-normality on Shapiro-Wilk is expected for surveys
- Doesn't invalidate analysis

**Action:**
- ✓ Keep original 1-5 satisfaction scores
- ✓ Use ANOVA + Kruskal-Wallis tests
- ✓ Report both results for robustness

---

## Decision 3: Why NOT Generate More Data?

**You already have enough:**
- Total n=323 respondents
- Per-group minimum: n≥30 ✓
- You have: n=71-138 (2-5x minimum) ✓

**Why generating data is bad:**
- Replaces real survey responses with artificial data
- Creates false precision
- Dishonest approach

**Won't help:**
- More data ≠ larger effect sizes
- Your small effect (η²=0.02) is real
- Only inflates statistical power, not practical meaning

**Action:**
- ✓ Use actual survey data as collected
- ✓ No synthetic data needed
- ✓ Report honestly

---

## Decision 4: Use Robust Estimation Methods

**Why robust methods matter:**
- Don't rely on normality assumptions
- Work well with Likert scale data
- Less influenced by outliers
- Better for real-world survey data

**Robust methods we use:**
- **Kruskal-Wallis Test** (non-parametric alternative to ANOVA)
- **Trimmed Means** (ignore top/bottom 5% of values)
- **Bootstrapped Confidence Intervals** (resample data to estimate uncertainty)
- **Median & IQR** (instead of mean & std dev)

**Action:**
- ✓ Report both parametric (ANOVA) and non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis) tests
- ✓ Use bootstrap CI for stratified estimates
- ✓ Report median satisfaction alongside means
- ✓ Acknowledge distribution assumptions in limitations

## Summary: Final Approach

✓ Stratified Sampling by 3 residence groups  
✓ Original Likert Scale data (1-5, no transformation)  
✓ Real Survey Responses (n=323, no synthetic data)  
✓ Both ANOVA & Kruskal-Wallis tests  
✓ Confidence intervals for estimates  

**Next Step:** Conduct final analysis and report results.
