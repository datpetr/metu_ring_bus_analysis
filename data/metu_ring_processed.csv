Ayrıca şu anki mor ve lacivert ringlerin efficient olmadığını düşünüyorum. Batıya gitmeden önce bütün kampüsü dolaşmak yerine kapılardan birinden batı yurtlara sonra kampüs turu sonre tekrar batı yurtlar yapması mantıklı olur. Şu anki sisteme akiam ringleri a1de doluyo(ilk durak) sonra doğuda biraz boşalıyor. Ben genrlde kütüphaneden yurda gitmek için kkmden biniyorum. 4 5 kişilik yer oluyor ve o da doluyor kkmde. Sonrasınds bölümler duraklarından geçmesi mantıksız çünkü yer olmadığı için inssnlar o duraklardan binemiyor. Onun yerine kampüs dışından batıya giden insanları batıya bıraktığı sonra doğudan ve bölümlerden batıya giden insanları 2. Turda batıya bıraktığı bir hat düzenlemesi daha yararlı olabilir. Eski a2den kalkan gri ringler bu açıdan daha verimliydi. Ayrıca mor ringlerin bu hali zaman açısından çok uzun. Kütüphaneden batıya yürüsen 20 dk ringle daha uzun.
